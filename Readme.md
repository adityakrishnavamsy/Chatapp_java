A chat application makes it easy to communicate with people anywhere in the world by sending and receiving messages in real time. With a real-time chat app, users are able to receive the same engaging and lively interactions through custom messaging features, just as they would in person.

The server and clients can run on different computers in the same network, e.g. Local Area Network (LAN). There can be multiple clients connect to a server and they can chat to each other, just like in a chat room where everyone can see other users' messages.
